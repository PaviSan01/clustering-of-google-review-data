The dataset comprises Google user ratings for various attractions in Europe, spanning 24 categories and totalling 5,456 instances. Each category—such as museums, beaches, parks, and restaurants—serves as an independent variable, reflecting the average user rating on a scale from 1 to 5 for that type of attraction. While the dataset does not include a specific dependent variable, it is primarily designed for unsupervised tasks like clustering.
